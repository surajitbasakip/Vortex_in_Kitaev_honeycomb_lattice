### Kitaev Honeycomb Model with Vortices

This notebook explores the eigenvalues of the Kitaev honeycomb model. 
## The following steps are carried out:
- Calculation of eigenvalues for the original model.
- Addition of two vortices and study of their impact.
- Examination of the energy splitting in the lowest energy states as vortices are brought closer.

## Key Steps:
- Theory: The Kitaev model is an exactly solvable model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, with significant relevance in quantum computation and topological phases of matter.
- Analysis: The energy splitting as vortices are brought closer provides insights into the interaction between localized Majorana modes.
